# Feed Our World

The inspiration behind Feed Our World is to address the food crisis in the world, which has been worsened by disasters, war, climate change, and pandemics. It also addresses the US sustainable goal 2: Zero Hunger. The archaic food supply chain system causes excess waste and inefficiency. The supply chain is highly affected and there is no application present today that can help NGOs, Restaurants, and Food-Producing donors donate their excess food to people in need. Thereby to make a disruptive change, I introduce "Feed Our World" which uses the XDC blockchain to resolve these issues and make this world hunger-free.

Feed Our World is a decentralized blockchain and Dapp-based solution that connects producers and consumers through an on-demand system. By streamlining the food acquisition process, reducing middlemen, and using blockchain technology to track food more efficiently, Feed Our World aims to put control of the food chain into the people’s hands, creating an On-Demand system and ushering in an era of food prosperity for all.

I built it using HTML, CSS, TypeScript, Solidity and XDC Blockchain. Feed Our World allows donors to track their donations and ensure that their contributions are being used for the intended purposes. The platform also enables transparency and accountability by leveraging the power of the XDC blockchain to record all transactions and donations securely.

One of the major opportunities for growth that the team encountered was integrating the XDC blockchain into the platform. I embraced the challenge of learning how to use blockchain technology and overcame the technical difficulties associated with it, which allowed us to improve our skills and expand our knowledge.

I am proud of the fact that I was able to develop a decentralized platform that is secure, transparent, and user-friendly. I also feel proud to have leveraged the power of the XDC blockchain to achieve our goals.

I learned a lot about blockchain technology and its potential for revolutionizing charitable giving. I also learned about the challenges associated with integrating blockchain into a web platform and the importance of user experience.

“No person will sleep with an empty Stomach”, is the main motto of the proposed application. Severing the hunger of the needy people and controlling the waste of food is the main concern. The team plans to continue developing the platform and expand its reach. I aim to partner with more charities and organizations to make the platform even more impactful. I also plan to add more features and capabilities to the platform to make it even more user-friendly and efficient. I am planning to keep working on this project and if I get the grant from XDC I will convert this idea into a non-profit startup which aims to reduce global food waste. I also built the next version figma of this idea and I will be building the next version soon after the Web3athon 2023 hackathon.
